1. I've included a SQL dump file. It will create a database if it doesn't exist called 'sliding_door'. If
you have already created a database or need to use a different database name, feel free to delete the
first two lines of the dump file.

2.  Create a cron job that will execute http://<domain name>/site/email_contact 1x per day. 

3. Update /application/config/database.php with your database settings. You will see two already setup in the database
file. You will see a database config called production. You can freely update the config to match your settings. You
should only have to update database, username and password. Hostname should only have to be updated if the mysql 
server is not running locally. In most cases it does.
